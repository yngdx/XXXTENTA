    in songs and Documental film. The fact that he died, He made an Instagram Live show telling his Fans that "When I'm dead

    and Lauderhill, Florida. When Onfroy was six years old, he allegedly tried to stab a man attempting to attack his mother and was 
    eventually put into a youth program before living with his grandmother. A source close to the Onfroy family denied that the

CAREER <br><br><br><br>
Canadian rapper Drake previewed a new track, titled "KMT", on January 28, 2017. The song, following its preview, was compared by
 users on social media to Onfroy's breakout song "Look at Me" due to the use of a similar triplet-heavy flow. Before the release
  of KMT, HotNewHipHop revealed that Drake followed Onfroy's account on Twitter. In an interview with XXL, Onfroy was questioned 
  about the Drake comparisons, responding "If Drake is gonna take the flow, and I don't know if he legitimately did, but if that is the 
  situation, at least reach out to a nigga, help a nigga out in this situation." <br> <br><br>

Drake released the mixtape More Life on March 18, 2017, which included "KMT". Onfroy was released from jail on probation two 
weeks later and was subsequently interviewed by WMIB, where he called Drake a "bitch" and said that he respected Drake's influence <br><br>

but felt like "KMT" was disrespecting him. The following day on Twitter, Onfroy posted a picture of Drake's mother saying
"she could get it". He then posted a picture of Drake's mother and a child version of Drake with Onfroy's face photoshopped 
over that of Drake's father, Dennis Graham. Later, in an interview with DJ Semtex, Drake denied those accusations that he 
stole Onfroy's "flow". Drake also denied knowing him and said that he only heard about him regarding rumors circulated following
the "KMT" snippet. Onfroy replied on his Twitter page requesting that Drake "come to Florida", after Onfroy saying that
he will not "Twitter rap with niggas"<br><br> <br>

Rapper Offset from the hip-hop group Migos used Instagram's livestream feature to verbally attack Onfroy, further escalating the feud.
Chicago rapper 600Breezy then claimed that Drake gave him permission to enter into the feud and attack Onfroy. 600Breezy told 
Onfroy that he has "got a couple niggas that will knock you off in your own city". 600Breezy later went to Florida to attempt to 
search for him, though it was fruitless. <br> <br> <br>

LEGACY <br><br><br><br>

During a concert in San Diego in June 2017, a physical altercation occurred, which led to Onfroy being knocked unconscious and an 
audience member being stabbed, though the injury was non-life-threatening. The assailant was reported to be an associate
of rapper Rob Stone, then involved in a feud involving Onfroy and Ski Mask. The feud had already led to Ski Mask the Slump God being
assaulted during rapper Desiigner's Outlet tour. Stone released a diss track following the attack, titled "Xxxtracredit", in
which he mentions the attack in San Diego and then proceeds to tell Onfroy to "not come back to California". Later in an interview,
Stone denied knowing who that assailant is. In October 2017, Stone confirmed that he and Onfroy had talked and resolved their
feud. <br><br><br>

EMOTIONAL <br> <br> <br> <br>
Onfroy met Geneva Ayala in November 2014.The two became in contact when Onfroy messaged Ayala saying that he wanted to fight 
her boyfriend after her boyfriend had allegedly posted scantily clad photos of her without her consent, though a fight never occurred.
 Ayala's at-the-time boyfriend alleged that she had punched and slapped him during breakdowns she had, though he admitted he had slapped
  her back occasionally to "snap her out of it".[307] Ayala's mother kicked her out when she was 16 and she had been living with her 
  at-the-time boyfriend until they broke up. In 2016, Ayala moved in with Onfroy and his roommates. <br> <br>


Onfroy's ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala had accused Onfroy of domestic abuse. According to Ayala's statement, Onfroy beat her at times, 
choked her, broke clothes hangers on her legs, threatened to chop off her hair or cut out her tongue, pressed knives or scissors to 
her face, and held her head underwater in their bathroom while promising to drown her."His favorite thing was to just backhand 
my mouth", Ayala says. "That always left welts inside my lips". <br><br><br>
Roommates of both Onfroy and Ayala describe Onfroy's remorse after the alleged incidents, and say that Onfroy said he
 "badly wanted to control his anger". This included an occasion where Onfroy was described as falling to his knees and weeping,
  begging to himself for his behavior to change. Some psychologists have speculated that Onfroy may have suffered from an attachment 
  disorder stemming from the absence of his mother and father during childhood, which could have made him prone to uncontrollable violent
   outbursts. Onfroy was re-diagnosed with bipolar disorder as an adult after initially being diagnosed as a child. Onfroy
    had been seeing a therapist and began taking medication by the time of his death. <br><br>

On New Year's Eve 2017, Onfroy entered a relationship with Jenesis Sanchez, which eventually became a domestic partnership. Sanchez said 
that in their relationship Onfroy showed changes in controlling his anger and would simply walk away if an argument ensued, rather than ever
 being physical. Onfroy began saying that he saw his deceased friend, Jocelyn Flores as his "guardian angel" and that it helped him to make 
 better decisions in his relationship. Three days after his death, Onfroy's mother announced on Instagram that Sanchez was pregnant with
  his child. In an interview, Sanchez said Onfroy was notified three weeks before he passed. The baby was confirmed to be a boy on 
  August 22, 2018, and was born on January 26, 2019, three days after what would have been his Father's 21st birthday. <br><br>

Onfroy was characterized by much of the media as homophobic following a widely seen interview he gave to Adam22 in April 2016. Onfroy told
Adam22 that, one time when he was in a juvenile detention facility, he attacked his gay cellmate for staring at him while naked. Onfroy 
explained, "I was gonna kill him type shit because of what he did", but was ultimately restrained. After Onfroy's death, Liz Lazzara's 
article for CNN described him as homophobic, and similar characterizations were made on social media. However, friends and collaborators said
he was not homophobic. In the same interview, Onfroy stated in clarification, "I am not homophobic", and expressed his support for the 
legalization of gay marriage. In a 2017 interview with The Fader which was released in November 2022, Onfroy mentioned that he
should have been clearer in the podcast in which he described the fight, stating he wished he had clarified that he did not attack his 
cellmate for the fact that he was gay, calling his discussion of the topic "negligent and stupid", but stated, "Everybody needs to realize
at the time I was still a kid." Regarding his political beliefs, Onfroy was praised as "incredibly progressive" by transgender
music producer Fifty Grand. Multiple transgender artists said in a 2020 biography that Onfroy was supportive of the transgender community.

XXXTentacion's ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala, who had accused him of domestic abuse in 2016, said of the controversy surrounding her and Onfroy's 
past, "It's disgusting that people are speaking for me. I don't care if no one cared about me however many months ago, I didn't lose my life.
 He did. It's permanent. I'm still here. Like, how do you think that makes me feel? Everyone expecting me to be relieved or happy? No, 
 I'm broken."Following XXXTentacion's death, Ayala appeared in the music video and the cover art for the 2019 single "Hearteater". <br> <br> <br> <br>
